<br>

Hello everyone! I am Aryaman Shardul, a final year undergarduate student in Computer Engineering at Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute (VJTI) in Mumbai, India.

<br>
I am a robotics enthusiast. I am interested in exploring the domains of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), Self-Driving Vehicles, Control Systems, Path Planning, Computer Vision, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and other allied domains.

<br>
Apart from academics, I was the Software Head of the Society of Robotics and Automation (SRA), VJTI. I delivered lectures to 150 plus freshmen on topics like line-following, self balancing, PID Tuning of a two wheeled bot, Morphology in Image Processing, ROS file systems and some basic ROS commands, etc. I also mentored a team of second-year students on a project called SLAM-CV-Navigation, which aims to implement SLAM on a differential drive bot in gazebo. Using a convolutional neural network called YOLO, the bot detects and follows humans in an indoor environment.

<br>
I am currently working as a research intern at Multi-Robot Autonomy Lab at IISER Bhopal.
