    <li> I am currently working as a research intern at the Multi-Robot Autonomy Lab at IISER Bhopal under the guidance of Dr. P. B. Sujit. </li>
    <li> I am working on implementing Dynamic Collision Avoidance Algorithms for UAVs using Neural Radiance Fields(NeRF). </li>
    <li> I have researched and learned about Neural Signed Distance Field and Incremental Signed Distance Fields(iSDF) and how they can be used for perception in UAVs. </li>
    <li> I am currently understanding and trying to modify the code of iSDF for our use case and holding a Literature Survey on dynamic obstacle avoidance algorithms. </li>

<b style="font-size:20px"> Project Title: MPC-based UAV Path Planning Algorithm With CFD-Based Wind Field Estimation. </b><br>
<b style="font-size:20px"> Project Duration: January 2023 - March 2024 </b>
</center>
<ul id="left">
    <li> Worked as a research intern at the Multi-Robot Autonomy Lab at IISER Bhopal under the guidance of Dr. P. B. Sujit and Dr. Manoj Kumar Tripathi. </li>
    <li> Studied the shortcomings of traditional Model Predictive Control (MPC) planners that assume the flow of the wind field in the environment to be constant, and designed a new MPC planner for the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), which takes into account the dynamic nature of the wind field. </li>
    <li> Utilized MATLAB and CasADi to write code for the MPC planner and simulate the trajectory of the UAV from a start point to a goal point, against different numbers of obstacles in itâ€™s path, and under the influence of a constantly changing wind field. </li>
    <li> The wind field was generated by designing a neural network that was created using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and DeepXDE. </li>
    <li> Conducted a comparative analysis of the results generated by the dynamic wind field MPC planner and the traditional constant wind field MPC planner, and found the results generated by the newly designed MPC planner to be more efficient. </li>
    <li> Drafted a research paper on this project preparing to submit it to a journal.</li>

<ul id="left">
    <li> Worked as an intern at the e-Yantra Lab at IIT Bombay for two months in a team on a project called "Prota: The ROS Bot", that aimed to create an efficient and modular design of an Unmanned Autonomous Ground Vehicle from scratch. </li>
    <li> Created the new design of the bot in CAD and replicated it in hardware, and assembled the hardware bot. </li>
    <li> Tested and worked with various sensors like RPLidar, MPU9250, Time of Flight sensors (VL53L0X), Intel Realsense D435i depth camera, etc, as well as used Raspberry Pi, Arduino and ESP32. </li>
    <li> Implemented Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) on the bot in simulation as well as on the hardware bot. </li>
    <li> Developed a navigation stack for the bot using ROS Noetic. </li>
