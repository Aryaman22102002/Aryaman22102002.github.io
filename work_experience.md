</center>
<ul>
    <li> I was an intern at the e-Yantra Lab at IIT Bombay for 2 months. </li>
    <li> I worked on a project called "Prota: The ROS Bot". The aim of the project was to create an efficient and modular design of an
    Unmanned Autonomous Ground Vehicle from scratch. </li>
    <li> Following that, we had to re-create the new design of the bot in hardware and implement Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) on it. </li>
    <li> My main focus in this project was to test and interface various sensors like RPLidar, MPU9250, Time of Flight sensors (VL53L0X), Intel Realsense D435i depth camera, etc, and work with Raspberry Pi, Arduino and ESP32. </li>
    <li> After that, I implemented SLAM on the bot in simulation as well as on the hardware bot. </li>
    <li> I also contributed to assembling the bot. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li> I am currently working as a research intern at the Multi-Robot Autonomy Lab at IISER Bhopal under the guidance of Dr. P. B. Sujit. </li>
    <li> I am working on implementing Dynamic Collision Avoidance Algorithms for UAVs using Neural Radiance Fields(NeRF). </li>
    <li> I have researched and learned about Neural Signed Distance Field and Incremental Signed Distance Fields(iSDF) and how they can be used for perception in UAVs. </li>
    <li> I am currently understanding and trying to modify the code of iSDF for our use case and holding a Literature Survey on dynamic obstacle avoidance algorithms. </li>

    <li> I am currently working as a research intern at the Multi-Robot Autonomy Lab at IISER Bhopal under the guidance of Dr. P. B. Sujit. </li>
    <li> I am working on implementing Collision Avoidance for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) using Model Predictive Control (MPC). </li>
    <li> The changing wind patterns around obstacles can increase the turning radius for UAVs which can lead to UAVs colliding with the obstacles. </li>
    <li> I am working on using a machine learning model to predict these wind patterns around obstacles. </li>
    <li> I have studied about Model Predictive Control(MPC) and designed a Model Predictive Controller using the Multiple Shooting Method to move the UAV from one point to another along an optimized path against a constant wind flow. I have also implemented obstacle avoidance using the MPC controller. </li>
    <li> I am currently working on generating flow fields around random points in the UAV's workspace. </li>
