     Hello everyone! My name is Aryaman Shardul. I am pursuing a master's in robotics from Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts. I completed my undergraduate degree in computer engineering from Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute in Mumbai, India.
    <br><br>
    I am a robotics enthusiast. I am interested in exploring the domains of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), Robot Perception, Path Planning, Control Systems, and other allied domains.
    <br><br>
    Apart from academics, I was the Software Head of the Society of Robotics and Automation (SRA), VJTI. I delivered lectures to more than 150 freshmen on topics like line-following, self-balancing, PID Tuning of a two-wheeled bot, Morphology in Image Processing, ROS file systems, some basic ROS commands, etc. I also mentored a team of second-year students on a robotics project based on SLAM and Computer Vision.
    <br><br>
    I was working as a research intern at the Multi-Robot Autonomy Lab at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Bhopal, India, and I also interned at the Embedded Real-Time Systems Lab at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay, India.
    <br><br>
    Currently, I am working at the <a href="https://siliconsynapse.sites.northeastern.edu/our-team/#:~:text=Electrical%20Eng.%0APerception-,Aryaman%20Shadul,-MS%20Robotics%0APerception">Silicon Synapse Lab</a> at Northeastern University on the Cobra robot. 
    <br><br>
    I will post all the other updates regarding my academic and research endeavors on this website shortly.
