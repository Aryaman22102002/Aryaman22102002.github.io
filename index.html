     Hello everyone! I am Aryaman Shardul, a final-year undergarduate student in Computer Engineering at Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute (VJTI) in Mumbai, India.
    <br><br>
    I am a robotics enthusiast. I am interested in exploring the domains of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), Robot Perception, Path Planning, Control Systems, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and other allied domains.
    <br><br>
    Apart from academics, I was the Software Head of the Society of Robotics and Automation (SRA), VJTI. I delivered lectures to 150 plus freshmen on topics like line-following, self-balancing, PID Tuning of a two-wheeled bot, Morphology in Image Processing, ROS file systems and some basic ROS commands, etc. I also mentored a team of second-year students on a project called "SLAM-CV-Navigation," which aims to implement SLAM on a differential drive bot in gazebo. Using a convolutional neural network called YOLO, the bot detects and follows humans in an indoor environment.
    <br><br>
    I am currently working as a research intern at Multi-Robot Autonomy Lab at IISER Bhopal since January 2023. 
    <br><br>
    I will post all the updates regarding the research paper I am working on as well as updates about other projects and internships on this website itself.
